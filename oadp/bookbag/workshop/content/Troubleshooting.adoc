If an issue is related to a specific backup or restore you may the following commands useful for troubleshooting:

`velero backup describe <backupName>` - describe the details of a backup

`velero backup logs <backupName>` - fetch the logs for this specific backup. Useful for viewing failures and warnings, including resources that could not be backed up.

`velero restore describe <restoreName>` - describe the details of a restore

`velero restore logs <restoreName>` - fetch the logs for this specific restore. Useful for viewing failures and warnings, including resources that could not be restored.

`oc logs deployment/velero -n openshift-adp` - fetch the logs of the Velero server pod. This provides the output of the Velero server processes.
